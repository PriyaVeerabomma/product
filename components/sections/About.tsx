                  Back in 2012, I channeled my creativity into designing custom boards and pins on Pinterest, which led
                  me to explore the world of coding and web development. This creative endeavor sparked a passion that
                  has carried me through various roles, from agile start-ups to large corporations.

                <p>
                  These days, my main focus is on building accessible and data-driven applications. I enjoy working at
                  the intersection of design and engineering â€” creating solutions that look good and perform
                  exceptionally well. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Software Engineering at
                  Northeastern University, engaging in projects like developing RAG engines and real-time chatbots.

                <p>
                  Professionally, As a Data Engineer at Cognizant Technology Solutions, I built scalable data pipelines,
                  integrated and processed data from various databases, and implemented machine learning algorithms to
                  enhance system performance.

                <p>
                  In addition to my technical skills, I serve as the Vice President of Finance for the Graduate Student
                  Government at Northeastern University, managing a substantial budget and ensuring financial
                  transparency.

                <p>
                  When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually doodling, editing videos, hanging out with my family, or
                  searching for the best Tiramisu in the city.
